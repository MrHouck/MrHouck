# Hello o/

I'm 17, and I love coding as a side hobby.
My main interests revolve around everything related airplanes -- aerospace, air traffic control, etc.
I'm most familiar with Python (~4 years of experience), but I love exploring other programming languages.
I'm currently working on my list of [2<sup>7</sup> programming challenges](https://github.com/MrHouck/2-7-Programming-Challenges), because I don't really know what I want to code anymore
